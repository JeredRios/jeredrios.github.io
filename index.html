    <h3>Artist Statement for Digital Media Arts</h3>
    <h5>My art explores...look, to be honest with you I don't quite know what I want to explore in art. I'm still trying to figure myself out, and that's probably the point of view from these works that should be considered when looking at them. Most of my projects consist of types of media that I have grown up around and have fallen in love with like movies and video games.  I'm currently a student at San Jose State who will be going into the Digital Media Arts program (Yes, even with this very crappy excuse for a last minute artist statement on my work because I genuinely don't know if it is actually worth anything). The programs I used to conduct my works at the moment are Adobe Premier, Adobe After Effects, Touchdesigner, and Audacity mainly. I do have some skills in graphic design, but my goal is to move into the digital space as that is where I see our world heading towards as we progress in the 21st century. While not trying to have one specific take on the world around me, the personality of myself slips in through the humor and even this amateur looking  site because I have no real talents and I can barely even fathom how anyone would want to hire be after looking at this artistic statement and the clear lack of knowledge or even last minute laziness that is on full display here. But, since you want me to say it, I am going into the digital art field because since high school, I've been drawn to many artistic endeavors such as music, drawing, painting, and one of my favorites being video editing. With the COVID-19 pandemic of right now, I have shifted my focus into learning how I can transfer the skills I have in physical art and making them digital, since I see one of the barriers of modern art being technology and how the general population can access and even participate with art. Look, here's my statement. Why do I have to give you a statement? Why is it not good enough that my work is evident on this page, I believe all are you are smart enough to see what is happening on this page. I will clean up this statement later, I'm just so mad that I can't come up with anything good to say about my work. And truth revealing time, I am burned out from this semester of online only class and being stuck alone in a place where I don't feel like anything I do will ever mean anything in this world. So here you go, this is my statement as an artist. This is my work, you like it? Cool. You don't? Hey I can't blame you I see the flaws in it the entire time. But I'm not going to change this approach just for a portfolio that I ultimately still think is a poor excuse of a portfolio to anyone with eyes and taste.Hope you like it. -Jered Rios </h5>

      <p>In an alternative universe of the BioShock canon, where Atlas’s plans do not come to fruition, Andrew Ryan continues to grow his great underwater utopia. Years pass by, and an older Ryan, less strong on his altruistic beliefs and becoming as growing Rapture to become as big and capitalist hungry as the United States he left, begins to see a problem with the incoming tourists that generate most of Rapture’s revenue.  The biggest seems to be that while the Big Daddies are a draw for the mainlanders to see, many haven’t gotten use to the sight of them or simply won’t come down near one, after the Great Daddy Massacre of ‘99, where 5 rouge daddies ended up murdering thousands of splicer, yet one regular citizen got in the way. The image of the Daddies, while iconic to Rapture, have started to leave a negative mark on their financial progress. Also seeing the opportunity from the growing Japanese tourists who have dominated the Big Daddy tours, Ryan and the other leaders of Rapture decide to placate to that audience. However, Ryan also becoming a huge shut-in weeaboo over the years who only watches anime, could only draw from this tap of knowledge when asked what he thought would make tourists calm. “Anime. Maids.” Ryan said. And so, it was, The Big Daddies are now officially 100% percent more kawaii, exude moe galore, and also function to now follow and be the servants of the visitors to Rapture. Will the plan work? Only time will tell, here’s the first mock up. </p>
